# game
My first own application after 2 months of learning programming. Tic tac toe Game.

Created in Java 8, depends on JavaFX (in Java9+ needed to include as separate dependency).
To start the game you need to run TicTacToe class.

Description:
The game allows you to choose symbol and put your name. 
It is a random property who starts the game and puts a symbol as a first - you or computer.
To win the whole game you need to pass 3 rounds. Then you can quit or start the game again.
